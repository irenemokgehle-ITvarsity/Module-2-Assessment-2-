            <h3>HUAWEI</h3>
                <img src="IMAGES/huawei%201.jpg"/>
                <p>Huawei is a Chinese information and communications technology (ICT)  company that specializes in telecommunications equipment. The company also offers services and consumer electronics including wearables, mobile broadband modems, smartphones, tablets and PCs.

A global partnership with DataCore Software announced in 2015 marked Huaweiâ€™s entry to the hyper-converged infrastructure market with products to be based on  Huawei hardware and DataCore's virtual SAN (VSAN) software. 

With over 170,000 employees, Huawei is the largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment in the world. Over 80 percent of major telecoms in 50 countries around the world have worked with Huawei. Nevertheless, some Western companies raise concerns that the company's ties to the Chinese government could lead to a risk of cyberspying, industrial espionage or sabotage.</p>
